## Work: 
### Stanford University School of Medicine
I'm currently working on a project called [MoTrPAC](https://www.motrpac.org){:target="_blank"}. The section of MoTrPAC I work on is called the Bioinformatics Center (BIC), a project in the [Ashley Lab](https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/). At a high level the entire project is aimed at understanding from a molecular level, what exercise does to the body. I work on the web portal where data will be submitted, analysed, and downloaded. I also help create the bioinformatic pipelines necessary for analysis of the data.

For the web portal I primarily develop the front end website using ReactJS. On the bioinformatic side I'm implementing a pipeline for analysis of methylation (RRBS) data with existing tools through WDL and Cromwell. 

## Future Plans: 
### Grad School
I have finished submitting applications for PhD Programs in bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, and biomedical engineering. Still waiting on responses and interviews, but I should begin Fall 2019.
