## As of January 2020
### Graduate School:
__Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA__  

I am beginning my second quarter at UCLA. My winter quarter rotation will be working on the link between migraines and depression through the [UCLA Depression Grand Challenge](https://grandchallenges.ucla.edu/depression/){:targe="_blank"} under [Dr. Alex Bui](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"}. My first rotation was under [Dr. Peipei Ping](https://cvdatascience.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/){:target="_blank"} working on cardiovascular data science. 

### Work:
__USC Keck School of Medicine__  
I currently work part time as a resource employee for the [Rong Lu Lab](https://ronglulab.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. A project studying acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has just had a manuscript submitted, and a second prject related to hematopoietic stem cell aging is being wrapped up.

### Future Plans:

__Entrepreneurship__  
My goal in beginning a Ph.D program was to understand bioinformatics and its applications in translational medicine enough to start a company in the field. I will be actively looking for the resources and mentors at UCLA and elsewhere to help ensure I am on the right track.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any information or advice.


## As of June 2019
### Work:
__USC Keck School of Medicine__  

I have been working at the Rong Lu Lab for about 3 months now. I spend most of my days making graphs about hematopoeitic stem cell clonal tracking and aging. We are in the early stages of assembling a manuscript on that work, and I'll be transitioning to a new project on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). 

### Future Plans:
__Grad Schools__  
I will be starting the Ph.D program in Bioinformatics at UCLA Fall 2019!

## As of March 2019
### Work:
__USC Keck School of Medicine__  

I left my job at Stanford to start working as a research programmer in Dr. Rong Lu's Lab at USC. The reason for this was to evaluate and experience working at USC as a candidate school where I may start my Ph.D. in Fall 2019 in Biomedical Engineering. It was a quick move: my last day of work at Stanford was Friday, March 8th and my first of work at USC was Monday, March 11th. 

I'm excited to begin working on developing software for analysis of this lab's unique data set that tracks hematopoietic stem cells at the single cell level!

### Future Plans:
__Grad Schools__  

Still waiting on final decisions but am very likely to attend a Ph.D. program somewhere in the LA area starting Fall 2019. 

## As of February 2019
### Work:
__Stanford University School of Medicine__  

I'm currently working on a project called [MoTrPAC](https://www.motrpac.org){:target="_blank"}. The section of MoTrPAC I work on is called the Bioinformatics Center (BIC), a project in the [Ashley Lab](https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. At a high level, the entire project is aimed at understanding from a molecular level, what exercise does to the body. I work on the web portal where data will be submitted, analyzed, and downloaded. I also help create the bioinformatic pipelines necessary for analysis of the data.

For the web portal, I primarily develop the front end website using ReactJS. On the bioinformatics side I'm implementing a pipeline for analysis of methylation (RRBS) data with existing tools through WDL and Cromwell. 

### Future Plans:
__Grad School__  

I have finished submitting applications for Ph.D. Programs in bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, and biomedical engineering. Still waiting on responses and interviews, but I should begin Fall 2019.
