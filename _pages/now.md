## As of July 6th 2020
### Coronavirus:
I spent the month of April at my significant other's place in San Francisco, returned to LA after she had to go to work in contact with COVID+ patients, got tested myself for COVID (I was negative), and then went to my parents' place in the Bay Area. I've been here for 2ish months and it's amazing how time flies when you're 23, live with your parents and your cat, and never leave the property. My S/O and I both got VR headsets (Oculus Quest) and they have been an absolute blast. 

### Systemic Racism:
In light of recent events, I’ve felt a personal responsibility to reflect on and address my own part in perpetuating racism and transphobia. Books, articles, and research on the topics are being consumed. However, while I believe self-education is a foundation on which to make meaningful change in this space, I also believe it is past time to take action in the areas I can help. I’ve been working with other students and faculty to help organize recurrent meetings to address systemic biases and healthcare inequality especially as they pertain to the group's research, graduate school workplace, and future program directions. I’m not the leader of this initiative, but am part of the organizing team (3 students, 1 faculty). We had our kickoff meeting last Friday and the participation and enthusiasm were very encouraging to see. I’m uncomfortable with and far from educated enough to speak well on the topic of systemic racism and anti-black sentiment, but am glad to be in a space where we can broach the subject with genuine effort. These issues are not new; I’m shocked it took a pandemic for me to see them.

### Graduate School:
__Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA__  
I'm a 1st year Medical Informatics PhD Student at UCLA. A couple weeks ago I joined [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab but before I can really begin my dissertation research will work on my Written Qualifying Exam (WQE). The WQE is a 6 week project. The first two weeks are spent finding a data set and proposing a research question. The latter 4 weeks are spent running experiments and writing a manuscript on the results. I begin that process tomorrow, July 7th. 
 
My Spring quarter rotation was under [Dr. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/){:target="_blank"} working on knowledge extraction from twitter in relation to COVID-19. My Winter quarter rotation was on studying the link between migraines and depression through the [UCLA Depression Grand Challenge](https://grandchallenges.ucla.edu/depression/){:target="_blank"} under [Dr. Alex Bui](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"}. My Fall rotation was under [Dr. Peipei Ping](https://cvdatascience.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/){:target="_blank"} working on cardiovascular data science. 


### Work:
__USC Keck School of Medicine__  
I currently work part time as a resource employee for the [Rong Lu Lab](https://ronglulab.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. A project studying acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has just had a manuscript submitted, and a second prject related to hematopoietic stem cell aging is being wrapped up.

### Future Plans:  
__Entrepreneurship__  
My goal in beginning a Ph.D program was to understand bioinformatics and its applications in translational medicine enough to start a company in the field. I will be actively looking for the resources and mentors at UCLA and elsewhere to help ensure I am on the right track.
