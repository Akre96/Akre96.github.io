## As of January 1st 2021
### The Pandemic:
My family, close friends, and I are all luckily safe and healthy through this time of storms, fire, and virus. I hope you are doing well through this also. 

### Racism and Inequity:
In light of recent events, I’ve felt a personal responsibility to reflect on and address my own part in perpetuating racism and transphobia. Books, articles, and research on the topics are being consumed. However, while I believe self-education is a foundation on which to make meaningful change in this space, I also believe it is past time to take action in the areas I can help. I'm lucky enough to have a group of friends organizing donation collections every week and giving to different groups to fight for racial justice. Over the summer I worked with other students and faculty to help organize recurrent meetings to address systemic biases and healthcare inequality especially as they pertain to the group's research, graduate school workplace, and future program directions. I’m not the leader of this initiative, but am part of the organizing team (3 students, 1 faculty). We had our kickoff meeting in July and the participation and enthusiasm were very encouraging to see. Since then we've had a series interactive and insightful presentations and discussions. In September we took time to reflect on what we can change within our program and research. We came up with a concise list of action items related to recruitment, mentorship, and internet presence, and have yet to fully address them. I hope to follow up on them this quarter.

### Graduate School:
#### Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA
I'm a 2nd year Medical Informatics PhD Student at UCLA in [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab. I recently passed my Written Qualifying Exam and have begun doing actual research. My research focus is on the use of social determinants of health (SDoH) in to routine healthcare through digital health approaches with the goal of reducing health disparities in vulnerable and underserved populations.

I recently worked on a project called [covidcompare.io](https://www.covidcompare.io){:targe="_blank} with two other students and went live with the website In November. I'll be conducting a usability study and hopefully publishing results in the comming months. Next I'll be working on the project of a recently announced [collaboration between UCLA and Apple](https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html) to study mental health and depression through mobile health initiatives.

I've been looking for internships for the Summer of 2021 and have been rejected from Verily, Facebook, Google, and a host of other companies. Planning to keep applying and hoping, and if you have any leads on medical informatics internships please send them my way :).

### Future Plans:  
#### Entrepreneurship
My goal in beginning a Ph.D program was to understand computational approaches in medicine in order to start a company in the field. Recently my goals and ambitions have shifted to where I can meaningfully help vulnerable populations. A company may be part of the solution but I'm not wed to the idea. I will be actively looking for the resources and mentors at UCLA and elsewhere to help ensure I am on the right track. I recently applied to [UCLA's biodesign fellowship](https://biodesign.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} as it aligns very well with my own goals. Interviews are ongoing and I hope I get this, but luckily I have a couple years of my PhD left to apply again.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any information or advice. My personal email is samir.akre@gmail.com.

### Other Things In My Life
#### Meditation
I've been meditating for a couple years now, and for most of it followed a mantra based meditation practice from [AYP](https://www.aypsite.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} which typically involves 2 ~30 minute sessions per day. Recently decided to shift to the methods taught in the book The Mind Illuminated by [Culdasa](http://culadasa.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. The main reason for this shift is I like the way stages of progression are laid out, and while I haven't finished the book, it has already influenced my focus, diligence, and quality of practice.

#### Guitar
I've played the guitar since I was in middle school, but never felt good. I'm still not good, I don't know how to "jam" with other players, don't know music theory. But at least I can solo in a minor pentatonic pretty well. I've started to learn more theory and fundamentals and am really enjoying it. Videos from [Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenEllerGuitars){:target="_blank"} have been very useful. 

#### Fitness
My roommate from the Freshman year dorms, Will Han, has been coaching me for the last month to help me get swole.
He's helped me a ton with understanding the right way to eat, how to look at my fitness goals, and how to workout. Lack of a full gym and rack limits my ability to get absolutely huge, but I've made real progress for the first time in my life. I was a bit anxious to try "bulking" given I spent the last decade tying to lose fat and reveal abs, but gaining weight is really paying off. I track calories on myfitnesspal and at 2100 calories with 150g protein, 260g carbs, and 60g fat as my macronutrient split. Starting at ~150lbs I'm now at ~160lbs. I'm happy with how my body looks and my fears of becoming too chunky reduced.
