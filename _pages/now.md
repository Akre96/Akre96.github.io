## As of September 16th 2020
### The Pandemic:
My family, close friends, and I are all luckily safe and healthy through this time of storms, fire, and virus. I hope you are doing well through this also. 

### Racism and Inequity:
In light of recent events, I’ve felt a personal responsibility to reflect on and address my own part in perpetuating racism and transphobia. Books, articles, and research on the topics are being consumed. However, while I believe self-education is a foundation on which to make meaningful change in this space, I also believe it is past time to take action in the areas I can help. I'm lucky enough to have a group of friends organizing donation collections every week and giving to different groups to fight for racial justice. I’ve been working with other students and faculty to help organize recurrent meetings to address systemic biases and healthcare inequality especially as they pertain to the group's research, graduate school workplace, and future program directions. I’m not the leader of this initiative, but am part of the organizing team (3 students, 1 faculty). We had our kickoff meeting in July and the participation and enthusiasm were very encouraging to see. Since then we've had a series interactive and insightful presentations and discussions. Last week we took time to reflect on what we can change within our program and research and will begin acting on the tasks we have decided. I plan to have a blog post detailing what we did and what is coming from that initiative some time this year.

### Graduate School:
#### Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA
I'm a 2nd year Medical Informatics PhD Student at UCLA. I am now in [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab. I recently submitted my Written Qualifying Exam and am excited to now start working on research. I'll be working on the project of a recently announced [collaboration between UCLA and Apple](https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html) to study mental health and depression through mobile health initiatives.
 
My Spring quarter rotation was under [Dr. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/){:target="_blank"} working on knowledge extraction from twitter in relation to COVID-19. My Winter quarter rotation was on studying the link between migraines and depression through the [UCLA Depression Grand Challenge](https://grandchallenges.ucla.edu/depression/){:target="_blank"} under [Dr. Alex Bui](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"}. My Fall rotation was under [Dr. Peipei Ping](https://cvdatascience.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/){:target="_blank"} working on cardiovascular data science. 


### Work:
#### USC Keck School of Medicine
I currently work part time as a resource employee for the [Rong Lu Lab](https://ronglulab.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. A project studying acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has just had a manuscript submitted, and a second prject related to hematopoietic stem cell aging is being wrapped up.

### Future Plans:  
#### Entrepreneurship
My goal in beginning a Ph.D program was to understand computational approaches in medicine in order to start a company in the field. Recently my goals and ambitions have shifted to where I can meaningfully help vulnerable populations. A company may be part of the solution but I'm not wed to the idea. I will be actively looking for the resources and mentors at UCLA and elsewhere to help ensure I am on the right track.

### Other Things In My Life
#### Meditation
I've been meditating for a couple years now, and for most of it followed a mantra based meditation practice from [AYP](https://www.aypsite.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} which typically involves 2 ~30 minute sessions per day. Recently decided to shift to the methods taught in the book The Mind Illuminated by [Culdasa](http://culadasa.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. The main reason for this shift is I like the way stages of progression are laid out, and while I haven't finished the book, it has already influenced my focus, diligence, and quality of practice.

#### Guitar
I've played the guitar since I was in middle school, but never felt good. I'm still not good, I don't know how to "jam" with other players, don't know music theory. But at least I can solo in a minor pentatonic pretty well. I've started to learn more theory and fundamentals and am really enjoying it. Videos from [Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenEllerGuitars){:target="_blank"} have been very useful. 

#### Fitness
My roommate from the Freshman year dorms, Will Han, has been coaching me for the last month to help me get swole.
He's helped me a ton with understanding the right way to eat, how to look at my fitness goals, and how to workout. Lack of a full gym and rack limits my ability to get absolutely huge, but hopefully I will be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle and continue progressing with at-home workouts.
