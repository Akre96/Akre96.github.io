## As of May 11th 2020
### Coronavirus:
I got tested for COVID-19 thanks to LA County initiatives and was confirmed negative. After getting the result I finally felt non-infectious enough to return to my parents house in Northern California where I'll likely be until July.

I'm really impressed with how quickly my research and class projects could be focused on helping with COVID-19 response. Good job UCLA.  

### Graduate School:
__Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA__  

I am in my third quarter at UCLA currently doing a rotation under [Dr. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/){:target="_blank"} working on knowledge extraction from twitter in relation to COVID-19. 

My winter quarter rotation was on studying the link between migraines and depression through the [UCLA Depression Grand Challenge](https://grandchallenges.ucla.edu/depression/){:target="_blank"} under [Dr. Alex Bui](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"}. My first rotation was under [Dr. Peipei Ping](https://cvdatascience.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/){:target="_blank"} working on cardiovascular data science. 


### Work:
__USC Keck School of Medicine__  
I currently work part time as a resource employee for the [Rong Lu Lab](https://ronglulab.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. A project studying acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has just had a manuscript submitted, and a second prject related to hematopoietic stem cell aging is being wrapped up.

### Future Plans:  
__Entrepreneurship__  
My goal in beginning a Ph.D program was to understand bioinformatics and its applications in translational medicine enough to start a company in the field. I will be actively looking for the resources and mentors at UCLA and elsewhere to help ensure I am on the right track.
